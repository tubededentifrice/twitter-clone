This file contains the history of prompts used with Claude Code to develop this Twitter clone project.

## March 9, 2025

### Add Generic Profile Picture

User Prompt:
- Requested to implement a feature to use a generic profile picture when users haven't set one

Claude:
- Implemented a local default avatar image to replace placeholder image URLs
- Created an assets directory in the React frontend to store the default avatar image
- Updated all components to use the local default avatar instead of placeholder URLs
- Modified Profile.js and Tweet.js components to import and use the default avatar
- This change provides a consistent generic profile picture when users haven't set their own

### Update Bootstrap Layout for Full Width

User Prompt:
- "Make sure the bootstrap style uses the whole width of the screen"

Claude:
- Modified App.js to use container-fluid instead of container for full-width layout
- Updated Navbar.js to use Container fluid instead of standard Container
- Changed Home.js to use Container fluid and removed column restrictions
- Updated Login.js and Register.js to use Container fluid and full-width columns
- Modified Profile.js to use Container fluid 
- These changes improve the application's appearance on larger screens and provide more space for content

### Update PROMPT_HISTORY Format

User Prompt:
- "In the PROMPT_HISTORY, ALWAYS indicate the user prompt in addition to what Claude did. Update your instructions accordingly."

Claude:
- Updated PROMPT_HISTORY_003.md format to clearly indicate both user prompts and Claude's actions
- Modified CLAUDE.md instructions to specify the required format for prompt history entries
- Ensured all future prompt history entries will include the exact user request and Claude's response
