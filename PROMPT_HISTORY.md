# Prompt History

This file contains the history of prompts used with Claude Code to develop this Twitter clone project.

## March 8, 2025

### Initial Setup
> Initialize this new repository. We will be making a Python web application, with the frontend based off the Bootstrap. Use the web framework you feel best suited. Initialize CLAUDE.md and README.md with all the relevant information, and always keep them up to date. The application will be a Twitter clone. Create a script to start the service locally for testing. For now, only create an empty home page "Hello world". Feel free to split the frontend and the backend if you deem appropriate.

Claude set up:
- FastAPI backend with basic structure
- Bootstrap frontend with simple homepage
- Project documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Local development script (run_local.sh)

### Prompt History Tracking
> Keep the whole prompt history in PROMPT_HISTORY.md; Add that instruction to CLAUDE.md

Claude added PROMPT_HISTORY.md and updated CLAUDE.md with instructions to maintain the prompt history.
