### Make Tweet Feed Viewable Without Login

User Prompt:
- "The base feed shouldn't required to be logged in; the default home page should display the feed (without being able to post to it of course)."

Claude:
- Modified the backend API to use optional authentication for tweet endpoints:
  - Imported `get_current_user_optional` dependency function in tweet.py
  - Updated the GET routes to use optional authentication for `/tweets/`, `/tweets/user/{username}`, and `/tweets/{tweet_id}`
  - Used the existing conditional rendering in the frontend to only show the tweet form when logged in
  - This allows unauthenticated users to view public tweets without logging in
